# Segmentation_GUI_Capstone_team7
**Team Repository for implementing GUI program of video segmentation in Capstone Design class**




**About This project**
------------
In this study, based on Video Object Segmentation technology based on Space-Time Memory Networks (STM) model, the purpose of this study is to create a GUI program that allows users to edit video in real time and interact with the computer.


**Python GUI**
------------
GUI was configured using Tkinter, video playback is possible on Python using Opencv, and Python image library (PIL) was used to bring various image file formats from Python.
In addition, Matplot has been implemented to bring up images that do not meet the uncertainty standard in the uncertainty part.
